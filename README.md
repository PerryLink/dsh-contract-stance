# dsh-contract-stance

**Boundary:** this plugin checks a **合同条款立场台账** for what a register can be held to — that each clause's
text is recorded, that your stance comes from your vocabulary, that the risk grade does too, that a must-have
clause records both a fallback position and an owner, that clause numbers are unique, that the register names
the contract and your side, and that no placeholder survives. It does **not** decide whether a clause should be
accepted, whether a risk is bearable, whether to sign, or whether a negotiating strategy is sound. **Those
depend on the deal, the counterparty's leverage and your own risk appetite.**

> **《中华人民共和国民法典》was obtained and read verbatim**, and `rules/evidence/clause-verification.md`
> records what was quoted: article 465 (a contract lawfully formed is protected by law), article 470 (contract
> content **一般包括** the parties, subject matter, quantity, quality, price, performance terms and liability for
> breach), article 509, article 577 (the consequences of breach) and article 584 (damages include expected
> profits but are capped by **foreseeability**).
>
> **The contract part does not regulate a negotiation register.** It governs formation, validity, performance and
> liability; the register's columns come from your enterprise's own contract management rules. So the `excerpt`
> fields still say "本次未取得" and every rule stays `warn` or `info`: **"this column is blank" must not be read
> as "this breaches the Civil Code".** Note also that article 470 says **一般包括**, not 应当包括 — one more
> reason `CS-001` does not claim a direct obligation.
>
> ⚠️ **Do not add a limitation-period rule to this plugin.** The Code *does* fix numbers — article 188 sets a
> three-year limitation (twenty years at the outside) and article 203 rolls a period forward off a public
> holiday — which makes "just compare the dates" look tempting. It is not workable here: the period runs from
> **when the creditor knew or ought to have known** of the harm and the debtor, a finding of fact the register
> does not record; the period is also subject to suspension (article 194) and interruption (article 195), and
> article 196 lists claims the limitation does not apply to at all. A date-arithmetic rule would dress a factual
> finding up as a calculation, which is precisely the over-claim this family avoids.
>
> **No judgement about the substance of a clause is made anywhere in this plugin.** It reads your own columns
> and checks only that they are filled and drawn from your vocabulary. Two vocabularies ship **empty** — the
> stance list (`CS-002`) and the risk grades (`CS-003`) — so with nothing configured those rules report
> themselves in `skipped` rather than passing quietly.

## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | Peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 \|\| >=0.2.0-0 <0.3.0` — verified to accept both `0.2.0-rc.2` and `0.2.1-alpha.1`. `engines.dsh` is deliberately not declared: it has no reader and cannot reject a host |
| Node | `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` |
| Platforms | All (plain ESM; no native code, no network, no model call) |
| Tool mode | Works in `native`, `ptc` and `both`; for a full contract use `ptc` |

## What it does

Registers the `contract_stance` tool. It reads one clause-position register — the contract header plus one row
per clause — applies a versioned rule pack, and returns a report.

| Rule | Check | Severity | Basis kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CS-001` | every clause's text is recorded | warn | principle |
| `CS-002` | the stance comes from your vocabulary (off by default) | info | local |
| `CS-003` | the risk grade comes from your vocabulary (off by default) | info | local |
| `CS-004` | a must-have clause records a fallback and an owner | warn | principle |
| `CS-005` | clause numbers are unique | warn | principle |
| `CS-006` | the register names the contract and your side | warn | principle |
| `CS-007` | the clause text holds no unreplaced placeholder | warn | principle |

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add dsh-contract-stance
dsh --profile <name> --dump-config | grep 'dsh-contract-stance'
```

## Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rulesFile` | string | `rules/contract-stance.yaml` | Rule-pack path, relative to the package root |
| `disabledRules` | string[] | `[]` | Rule ids to stop running; each appears in `skipped` |
| `onlyRules` | string[] | `[]` | Run only these rule ids; empty runs every rule |
| `skipNotes` | string | `""` | Note appended to every `skipped` reason |
| `timeoutMs` | number | `120000` | Cooperative tool timeout budget |

Rule-level parameters worth knowing:

- `CS-002` `values` — your stance vocabulary, e.g. `[坚持, 可谈, 接受, 须删除]`. Empty means no check.
- `CS-003` `values` — your risk grades, e.g. `[高, 中, 低]`. Empty means no check.
- `CS-004` `conditionValues` — the values in your 是否必保 column that mark a clause must-have, by default
  `[是, Y, yes, true, 必保, √]`.
- `CS-007` `terms` — the placeholders to look for.

## Material format

The tool accepts JSON or YAML:

```yaml
contractNo: HT-2026-018
contractName: 某某设备采购合同
party: 某某公司
version: 第 3 轮谈判稿
rows:
  - { 条款号: 第 8.2 条, 条款主题: 逾期付款违约金,
      条款原文: 买方逾期付款的，每逾期一日按未付金额的万分之五向卖方支付违约金。,
      本方立场: 可谈, 风险等级: 中, 风险说明: 违约金比例高于本方惯例且未设上限,
      退让底线: 比例可降至万分之三，须增加总额不超过合同额 5% 的上限,
      是否必保: 是, 谈判责任人: 王经理 }
```

Column names are matched case-insensitively and ignoring spaces, underscores and hyphens; the register's own
column names are kept, so a finding names the column it read.

## Rule sources

Rule data lives in `rules/contract-stance.yaml`. The pack's header states the citation gap in full, and each
rule's `note` repeats the part that matters for that rule. The load-time guard that normally enforces "an
excerpt must be a real quotation of at least eight characters" cannot tell a quotation from a description —
so this pack leans on the header, the per-rule notes and a test that asserts every `excerpt` admits the gap.

## Troubleshooting

- **`CS-002` or `CS-003` reports itself as skipped.** Its vocabulary is empty. Stance and risk wording is your
  institution's convention, and the plugin will not guess it.
- **`CS-004` fires on a clause marked must-have.** It records no fallback or no owner. A must-have clause
  without a stated floor cannot be negotiated on the spot.
- **`CS-001` fires although the clause is quoted elsewhere.** The `text` column itself is empty. The check
  reads the register, not the contract document.
- **`CS-005` fires on one clause twice.** That is legitimate across negotiation rounds — distinguish the rows
  in the version column rather than reusing the clause number.
- **The plugin installs but the tool never appears.** Check that `main` resolves to `lib/index.mjs` and
  that `pnpm run build` produced it; a wrong `main` makes the loader skip the entry silently.
- **`dsh plugin add` refuses the package as incompatible.** The peer range covers `0.1.x` and `0.2.x`; if
  your runtime sits outside it, grant an explicit exemption:
  `dsh plugin --profile <name> allow-version dsh-contract-stance@0.1.0 --dsh-version <runtime> --accept-risk`
- **`check` reports `manifest-peers` as failed.** The static checker compares against a hard-coded peer
  range that predates the 0.2 line. The runtime enforces peer compatibility at install time, so the
  declared range is the correct one; this is a known upstream issue in `dsh-plugin-dev`.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test            # vitest, the shared table-plugin suite plus paired fixtures
pnpm run build       # tsdown -> lib/index.mjs + lib/index.d.mts
node ../scripts/sync-shared.mjs dsh-contract-stance   # refresh src/shared from ../_shared
```

The plugin is **data-only**: `src/model.ts` declares the table shape, the shared kit supplies the reader and
the check engine, and the rule pack declares every check.
